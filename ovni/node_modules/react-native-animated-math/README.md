[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-animated-math.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-animated-math)
![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rastapasta/react-native-animated-math.svg)

An Animated API math extension - implementing Sinus, Cosinus, Tangens and others as AnimatedNodes.

All calculations are implemented based on chained

* Animated.add
* Animated.divide
* Animated.multiply
* Animated.modulo

**Readme is WIP**

## Getting started

Simply add it to your project by calling

`$ react-native add react-native-animated-math`

## Usage

Simple example of using the `AnimatedMath` methods to realize a natively animated circular moving view:

```js
import { Animated } from 'react-native';
import AnimatedMath from 'react-native-animated-math';

class Rotator extends React.Component {
  state = {
    angle: new Animated.Value(0)
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.timing(this.state.angle, {
      toValue: 2*Math.PI,
      duration: 4000,
      useNativeDriver: true
    }).start();
  }

  render() {
    let {angle} = this.state,
      radius = 130;

    return (
      <Animated.View style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        transform: [
          {translateX: Animated.multiply(AnimatedMath.sinus(angle), radius)},
          {translateY: Animated.multiply(AnimatedMath.cosinus(angle), -radius)},
        ]
      }]}/>
    );
  }
}
```
